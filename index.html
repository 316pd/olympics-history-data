    <h2>About Data</h2>
    <p>This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. I have taken this data from <b>Kaggle</b>.</p>
    <p>Note that the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. After that, they staggered them such that Winter Games occur on a four year cycle starting with 1994, then Summer in 1996, then Winter in 1998, and so on. A common mistake people make when analyzing this data is to assume that the Summer and Winter Games have always been staggered. For this project we have consider only Summer data.</p>
